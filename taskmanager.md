## Quick Restart Commands

When restarting work after interruption, run these commands:

```bash
# 1. Check current status
cd /home/pi/happy_button
git status
ls -la

# 2. Review configuration
cat CLAUDE.md
cat config/company.yaml

# 3. Check Claude Flow status
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm_status
npx claude-flow@alpha agent_list

# 4. Start development session
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind init
npx claude-flow sparc modes

# 5. Continue with current phase
# (Reference current phase section above)
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Startup Checklist
1. [ ] Read this taskmanager.md to understand current status
2. [ ] Check CLAUDE.md for project configuration
3. [ ] Review completed tasks to avoid duplication
4. [ ] Identify next priority task from backlog
5. [ ] Initialize Claude Flow session
6. [ ] Set up TodoWrite with current tasks

### Task Completion Workflow
1. **Before Starting**: Update task status to "in_progress"
2. **During Work**: Use parallel operations (single message batching)
3. **Testing**: Always test changes before marking complete
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Completion**: Mark task as "completed" and update this file

### File Organization Rules
```
DO NOT save to root folder. Use:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/           # Source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/         # Test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/          # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/        # Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ samples/       # Generated samples
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/     # Email templates
```

## Key Configuration Files

### Essential Files to Review

- `config/info_mail_handling.yaml` - Email processing rules
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `README.md` - Project overview

### Generated Files (Reference Only)
- `.claude/` - Claude Flow configuration
- `.hive-mind/` - Hive mind system
- `.swarm/` - Swarm coordination
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies

## KPI Targets & Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs

- **Average response time**: ‚â§ 1 hour
- **On-time shipping**: ‚â• 90%

### Secondary Metrics
- Agent coordination efficiency
- Template compliance rate
- Escalation accuracy
- Customer satisfaction scores

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Claude Flow errors**: Check MCP server status
2. **Agent spawn failures**: Verify swarm initialization
3. **File organization**: Ensure no files in root directory
4. **Performance issues**: Monitor hive-mind database
5. **Configuration errors**: Validate YAML syntax

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check system health
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm_monitor
npx claude-flow@alpha agent_metrics

# Validate configuration
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/company.yaml'))"

# Reset if needed
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind reset

## Context for AI Assistants

When an AI assistant resumes work on this project:

1. **Read this file first** to understand current status
2. **Check CLAUDE.md** for technical configuration
3. **Review completed tasks** to avoid duplication
4. **Identify current phase** and next priority tasks
5. **Use TodoWrite** to track new work
6. **Follow file organization rules** (no root folder saves)
