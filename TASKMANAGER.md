- [✅] PDF Parser (order/invoice) → JSON schema + tests *(COMPLETED: Full implementation with 11 unit tests, all passing)*
- [✅] Order state machine service + events *(COMPLETED: 11-state lifecycle operational)*
- [✅] Unit agents wired (Info, Sales, Production, Logistics, Finance, Quality, Support, Purchasing, HR, Mgmt) *(COMPLETED: All business unit agents active)*
- [✅] Dashboard MVP (flows + KPI tiles) *(COMPLETED: Multiple dashboards operational on ports 80, 8085, 8090)*
- [✅] History seeder + repeatable day script *(COMPLETED: €83,888.60 daily order generation)*

**Additional Completions (2025-09-27)**
- [✅] **Navigation Enhancement**: Demo Flow integrated into all dashboard navigation menus
- [✅] **System Integration**: Multi-port dashboard system operational
- [✅] **Real Email Processing**: Live email server integration functional
- [✅] **PDF Processing**: Complete PDF parser for orders/invoices with JSON schema conversion
- [✅] **Agent Status Display**: Real-time "Verarbeite" status showing for active agents (127+ processed emails)
- [✅] **Version Update**: Application updated to Release 2.2 - Enhanced Business Simulation

**Acceptance**
- [✅] E2E happy path visible; replay deterministic *(COMPLETED: Visible on dashboards, deterministic daily generation)*

## R3 — Weakness Injection ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Scenarios**
- [✅] Late triage (info@) *(COMPLETED: Implemented with email delay simulation and SLA violations)*
- [✅] Missed expedite (24h for 10× profit) *(COMPLETED: Revenue impact tracking with expedite request failures)*
- [✅] VIP Royal Blue request ignored *(COMPLETED: VIP mishandling simulation with reputation damage)*
- [✅] Global disruption (Suez) *(COMPLETED: Supply chain disruption with cascading impact modeling)*

**Implementation Details (2025-09-27)**
- [✅] **Scenario Manager**: Complete orchestration system with configuration management
- [✅] **API Endpoints**: Full REST API at `/api/v3/scenarios/*` for scenario control
- [✅] **Dashboard Integration**: Scenarios page at `/scenarios` with real-time monitoring
- [✅] **Email Generation**: Automatic scenario email generation (13+ files generated)
- [✅] **KPI Integration**: Real-time impact tracking through KPI system

**Acceptance**
- [✅] KPI degradation visible + incident notes *(COMPLETED: Real-time KPI impact monitoring operational)*
- [✅] Scenario activation/deactivation functional *(COMPLETED: Tested enable/start/stop operations)*
- [✅] Email simulation generates realistic failure scenarios *(COMPLETED: Verified with test scenarios)*
