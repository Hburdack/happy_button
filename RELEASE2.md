## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install PyYAML pdfplumber PyPDF2
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
cd src
python test_release2.py
```

### Start Demo System
```bash
cd src
python demo_release2.py 5  # Run for 5 minutes
```

```

## 📊 System Configuration

### Business Settings (`sim/config/company_release2.yaml`)

```yaml
# SLA definitions
sla:
  critical: 2    # hours
  oem: 4         # hours
  default: 12    # hours
  expedite: 24   # hours

# OEM customers get priority handling
oem_customers:
  - "oem1.com"
  - "oem2.com"
  - "bigcorp.com"

# Agent configuration
agents:
  sales:
    auto_approve_limit: 1000  # Euro
    max_concurrent: 3
```

## 🎯 Business Process Flow

### 1. Email Reception
- IMAP service polls configured mailboxes

- **Support** → SupportAgent (future) with technical routing
- **Billing** → FinanceAgent (future) for account resolution

### 3. Order Processing
- PDF attachments parsed for order data
- Order created in state machine (CREATED state)
- SalesAgent reviews and auto-approves qualifying orders
- State transitions through production pipeline

### 4. Response Generation
- Royal courtesy templates selected based on inquiry type
- Courtesy scoring validates professional tone
- Auto-replies sent with appropriate SLA commitments

### 5. Business Intelligence
- Real-time metrics collected and stored
